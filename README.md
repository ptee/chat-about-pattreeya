# Chat with an AI Bot That Knows You!
This demo combines LangChain (for LLM orchestration) and Streamlit (for the UI) to create a personalized chatbot experience. It uses Supabase instead of PostgreSQL for testing.

### Credits:
This code was inspired by Thomas Janssen's "Agentic RAG with LangChain".
